# This is DICE! (a cmdline game)
### It's a project I made to learn C++
It took about a day to complete, most of that time was spent making the graphics and copying from the graphics file to the programs BTW: The die faces looked way better in notepad++
### HOW IT WORKS:
A R.N.G (std::mt19937) is seeded with time and used to generate a number between 1-6 (Number of die faces) which then prints the die face after the title.

### DICE 2D GAMEPLAY:
As you can see the options are: Enter to roll, Q to quit. It's the same with DICE3D.
